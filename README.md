# 🍕 Java Pizza State Machine Series

This is a practical project that demonstrates how to implement a **State Machine** using **Java**. 

The example simulates a pizza order flow, going through states like `ORDER_RECEIVED`, `PREPARING`, `ASSEMBLING`, and `BAKING`, until reaching `READY` or being `CANCELLED`.

This project is divided into three modules:

1. [`module-raw`](./modulo-raw/README.md): Manual implementation, no frameworks.
2. [`module-fw`](./modulo-fw/README.md): Implementation using Spring StateMachine-Framework.

> 📌 Check the README.md of each module for more details.

## 🎥 YouTube Series

This project is part of a **video series** on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielbragadev), aiming to:

- Teach the concept of state machines
- Show how to implement them manually
- Demonstrate how Spring can help simplify the setup and transitions
